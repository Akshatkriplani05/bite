                I do not wanna loose you at any point of time in life . I do like you so much that even your breathe makes me happy ...may be i am not to expressive aur mai nhi bol pata hi calls pr but really muje tere se bate krna bhaut acha lgta hai 
                Muje shyd pta bhi nhi hai how to say this 
                But yaa you won my heart and happily and i am saying that "I love you ❤"

                Please mujse ab wait nhi hota . My feelings are genuine and i want to be lost in the world of you 
                Ha hum mile utna nhi hai but ye na milke bhi itna ek durse se attach ho jana
